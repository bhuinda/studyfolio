Given that I approached sheaf theory so quickly from heuristics alone, I think it's really worth investigating categorical pedagogy and the intuition of binary, rotations, poles, imaginaries, etc.!

One must be a sea, to receive a polluted stream without becoming impure.

does prime number distribution have non-trivial periodicity if conjoining within modulo 2 or 4?

The transcendental octonions are said to functionally encode the associativity of the quaternions


the infinite faces, or neighborhoods, of the 0-asymptote are orthogonal to (0,0) but not to each other. each neighborhood, then, represents an arrow of time that was *always* there, none of which intersect, and all of which "rotate" around the spaceless vacuum with infinitely unique angles, for a transcendental infinity series. this encodes symmetry of rotation.

line, or =

extending out in any direction, we now have a 0-infinite valued scalar that encodes orthogonal rotations along its infinite integer modulus. using the line as the basis of comparison for any two adjacent neighborhoods, the angle formed is only nearly equal.

maybe * = AND | OR?

symmetry line * line of some length that nudges = approximate hypotenuse (asymptotic; no roots)

I intuitively associated sqrt 5 with a 2:1 triangle construction ratio and reinvented the Pythagorean theorem hahahaha. I think this is a pretty safe bet that it explicitly relates logical configuration. which then means that sqrt 5 is the natural root, or value, of "sublation"...? bruh. if that's the case, then it immediately becomes obvious why it's irrational... it's describing the transcendental ideal/structural integer representation of the dialectical function. Observe that macroscopic nature has a "divine" tendency to continuously differentiate itself according to the golden ratio; e.g., the automatic preference of plants to shape their flowers and leaves accordingly.

is the constant provided by the antiderivative of sqrt(5), then, simply the integer representation of the fractal dimension??? where multiplication has infinitely variable, stochastic-like behavior??????? and is then the derivative of non-associativity (i.e., the empty set)? woah.

if the exact same plant structure was simulated to grow with ideal conditions, would it always grow *slightly* differently? would perfect similarity be possible or rational? or perhaps, if the question is indeterministic, then would it prove that natural and ideal logic are dependent upon each other? assuming plants can never have ideal identity, then it would reinforce the intuition that sqrt(5) may be the ultimate mathematical description of a "unit of value."

not sure if significant or trivially similar. if i'm not schizo and this could be a non-trivial value, could it be the log10 ideal of the average difference in self-similarity patterns?

2^sqrt(5)^2 

i think this is the point in the narrative where arithmetic emerges, but i need to study the patterns much deeper... it encodes category theory and whatnot, so it's a little tricky - _ -

only two configurations of powers where 5 is a unique sum of primes normalized to mod2
12 = (2^5) - (2^3) - (2^2) - (2^2) - (2^2) mod5 <- mod6?
12 = (2^5) - (2^3) - (2^3)  - (2^2) mod4 <- mod5?

(2^2^2) - (2^2)
3(2^2 + 2)

encodes 1st and 4th dimension simultaneously??

thus, three fundamental identities of 0-ness, or normalities
unary -> invariant; notion of countability?
d0 = a - b - 3c; d0/a = b + 3c

unary -> variant, variant; notion of partiality?
d0 = a - 2b - c; d0 wrt a = 2b + c
d0 = a - 2b - c; d0 wrt c = 2b + a
(and here we have a representation of the dialectic and its configurations.)
(not a Pythagorean triple, so it's informational, rather than ideal?? eh)

1 or |?| = d = 2^1 + sqrt(5)^2 
|1| = a = 2^5 
|1| = b = 2^3 
|3| = c = 2^2 

1 or |?| = d = 2^1 + sqrt(5)^2 
|1| = a = 2^5 
|2| = b = 2^3 
|1| = c = 2^2 

(and complements)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-analog

if the degree change caused by the parity correction function of self-similarity is significant enough (natural representation in the Riemann theorem?), then a strong relation holds/is prescribed for its extension field:

encodes 2nd and 3rd dimension; Euclidean 2-, 3-spaces
2a = 2b - 2c
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 

thus, non-trivial (pseudo-scalar, pseudo-vector) physical constructions like those derived from the Standard Model become possible.

(analytic continuation ought to demonstrate that, regardless of the notion that the hypotenuse can be completed in an ideal fractal, the infinitesimal flux of the fractal dimension appears to "vibrate" every one of its progeny, such that their field is differentiable as point-like and line-like; aka, they're Hilbert spaces. this ought to give rise to quantum stochastics statistics.)


taylor series, teichmuller space, moebius transforms...

it is important to feel these intuitions just as it is to know them (assuming they mean anything at all!)
