reading about Apery's constant, the fact that a Thue-Morse sequence was used to calculate zeta(3) is fascinatingly similar to the process I used.
what is the significance of manipulating symmetrical binary for zeta(4)?

ln(1.9671824e+17) = 39.8205488461
...919871824      = from decimal expansion of "5/4 + Pi^2/8 + zeta(3)"

39.8205488461
39 8205846893 (square root of 39; on 14th s.f.)
39 6205443310 (cube root of 91; on 22nd s.f.)

more trivially seeming, the half-integer of mod5 (2.5) has a difference of only 0.072 between its n - 1 and n terms. this is approximately 1/14 (7.142857...). it's hard to put my finger on it, but it seems that through a "natural" rounding function, then adding 2 to the fraction, the symmetry lines up, and 4 -> 5. is this periodic behavior, with a scaling factor of 2 to modulate between sig figs? i noticed this pattern in the approximate integer series of the other natural constants, like the 39... example. Its proximity to 40 implicates how base 10 interacts with a scaling factor 4, or 2 * 2; alternatively, how 10 = 5 * 2, and how that decimal even/prime correspondence encodes irrational numbers?

this intuition is also possibly suggesting that if we know how the fractional integers of an irrational or infinitesimal number map a matrix for a compact integer (scalar) representation, then we would be able to know its "significance," or sufficient decimal precision. could be helpful/damning for understanding measurement problems?

zeta(4): 1, 0, 8, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 7, 1, 1, 1, 3, 8, 1, 9, 1, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0, 3, 6, 9, 6, 5, 4, 1, 1, 6, 7, 9, 0, 2, 7, 7, 4, 7, 5, 0, 9, 5, 1, 9, 1, 8, 7, 2, 6, 9, 0, 7, 6, 8, 2, 9, 7, 6, 2, 1, 5, 4, 4, 4, 1, 2, 0, 6, 1, 6, 1, 8, 6, 9, 6, 8, 8, 4, 6, 5, 5, 6, 9, 0, 9, 6, 3, 5, 9, 4, 1, 6, 9, 9, 9, 1

 .10823232 (sig. fig.s become trivial on .00000001 -> .00000002; 8 sig. fig.s)

 .108232 (symmetry breaks on .000001 -> .000002; 6 sig. fig.s)
 .1082311 (symmetry breaks on .0000000 -> .0000001; 7 sig. fig.s)
 .10823109 (symmetry breaks on .00000008 -> .00000009; 8 sig. fig.s)
 900000109

referencing square root here:
5.108232 - 5.108231 (one action away from 90) = 1.0e-6
5.108232 - 5.10823108 (action of exactly 90) = 9.2e-7

5.10823232 - 

5.10823232 = 90.0000109
8 decimals required

log(...) * sqrt(5 + 0.108232) = 90.0000109
on 6th decimal, symmetry breaks

log(...) * sqrt(5 + 0.10823108) = 90
almost exactly zeta(4)

Gravity is a numerical concept? i.e., the rationals "attract" via floor/ceiling intuition? thus, an analogy for edge of chaos

Consider categorical analysis of chaos theory, with a focus on logistic mapping and the criticality of the integer 3 for periodicity.

x_0 = 0.5 # 11 / 00

x_1 = 9.0 # 1001

x_2 = 195.0 # 11000011

x_3 = 3591.0 # 111000000111

x_4 = 61455.0 # 1111000000001111

x_5 = 1015839.0 # 11111000000000011111

(ln(0.5)+ ln(9) + ln(195) + ln(3591) + ln(61455) + ln(1015839)) * sqrt(5) ~ 89


(ln(1) + ln(9) + ln(195) + ln(1791) + ln(61681) + ln(1015839)) * sqrt(5) + 1 ~ 90

almost exactly to 90: sqrt5.10823108


If ln(1) is changed to ~ ln(1.53343971), it equals 90 without + 1

1.618033988749

(ln(2)/ln(4) + ln(9) + ln(195) + ln(1791) + ln(61681) + ln(1015839)) * sqrt(5)
is approximately 90.1620849511446

what if the ln series is extended to 12 terms?

90.162085         * 3.005698  = 269.99... deg
90.golden ratio * 3.0057074 = 271 deg

5.7074 × 10^−3 of error

In nature, the golden ratio appears because it is an approximation of this error?

Mind that the decimal is not 100% precise; but if the integer representation of i is 90.044051, then it takes 3mod12 full turns (and a nudge!) before the log10 decimal becomes precise enough to use a ceiling function to achieve exactly 1 degree of error (natural degree + 1); otherwise, the floor function remains prevalent. In subtracting 1 to account for this degree of error, what if we are introducing the potential of another module of i?

Every function's probability of a zero/non-zero with a set of parameters can be thought of as this:

A function of degree 1 can have multiple probabilistic values if its exponent extends by the rational numbers. If wavefunctions represent probability densities, then the primal coefficients may simply be their normalized frequency across a smooth integer.

Absolute value of a function is
Ceiling function + find highest probability (modulo p - n)?
