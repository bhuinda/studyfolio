Gravity is a numerical concept? i.e., the rationals "attract" via floor/ceiling intuition? thus, an analogy for edge of chaos

Consider categorical analysis of chaos theory, with a focus on logistic mapping and the criticality of the integer 3 for periodicity.

x_0 = 0.5 # 11 / 00

x_1 = 9.0 # 1001

x_2 = 195.0 # 11000011

x_3 = 3591.0 # 111000000111

x_4 = 61455.0 # 1111000000001111

x_5 = 1015839.0 # 11111000000000011111

(ln(0.5)+ ln(9) + ln(195) + ln(3591) + ln(61455) + ln(1015839)) * sqrt(5) ~ 89


(ln(1) + ln(9) + ln(195) + ln(1791) + ln(61681) + ln(1015839)) * sqrt(5) + 1 ~ 90



If ln(1) is changed to ~ ln(1.53343971), it equals 90 without + 1

1.618033988749

(ln(2)/ln(4) + ln(9) + ln(195) + ln(1791) + ln(61681) + ln(1015839)) * sqrt(5)
is approximately 90.1620849511446

what if the ln series is extended to 12 terms?

90.162085         * 3.005698  = 269.99... deg
90.golden ratio * 3.0057074 = 271 deg

5.7074 × 10^−3 of error

In nature, the golden ratio appears because it is an approximation of this error?

Mind that the decimal is not 100% precise; but if the integer representation of i is 90.044051, then it takes 3mod12 full turns (and a nudge!) before the log10 decimal becomes precise enough to use a ceiling function to achieve exactly 1 degree of error (natural degree + 1); otherwise, the floor function remains prevalent. In subtracting 1 to account for this degree of error, what if we are introducing the potential of another module of i?

Every function's probability of a zero/non-zero with a set of parameters can be thought of as this:

A function of degree 1 can have multiple probabilistic values if its exponent extends by the rational numbers. If wavefunctions represent probability densities, then the primal coefficients may simply be their normalized frequency across a smooth integer.

Absolute value of a function is
Ceiling function + find highest probability (modulo p - n)?
