We differentiate in fields of mod 2 (binary linear algebra); generate elements via chain complexes of mod 3 (dialectical action); and order in cochains of mod 4 (categorical squares of logic).

Absolutely fascinating: "geometric frustration"

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_frustration
Oh my God. I'm pretty sure that is it lol. That's what the fuckass equation is doing. How do I go about proving this??

Connection to Bravais lattices?

170... 10 * 10 + 10 * (2^3 - 1)

This feels like some big thing for universal algebra. A connection between geometry, representation theory, and algebraic lattices... The connection between phenomena and language... The process and realization of discreet quanta. All hail √5

Humor is the art of labeling the absurd.

A more effective narrative for dialectical logic is considered through a dialogue about time:

Let there be a dialectic.

Let spacetime represent a dialectic of an object and a function.

Time is the function of space: an object acting upon itself to return itself. The sublation of this action encodes an object's dualism and function.

f(f) := f ⊆ f.

Object function is the encoder of geometry and nature: distinct; stochastic; transcendental; variable; imperfect.

f(N) := homological algebra; category of topology, or simply sheaves.

Object dualism is the ultimate consequence of a geometric object: perfection; invariable; binary; natural.

f(Z) := heterological algebra; category of Galois rings, or simply rings.

Thus, an object is functional, by appealing to our presupposition of spacetime as an element of generation. It may be qualitatively attributed with a duality of variants and invariants; the interaction of homological algebra and heterological modulo; the sensation of geometry.

We quantitatively attribute these objects with numbers; we interpret their meaning through the complex analysis of the dialectic.

The progression of prime numbers may as well be the passage of time.

What if counting systems fundamentally influence cognition? What if our brains are still mostly naïve from limiting our imagination to a base of ten? It was recently discovered that humans, on average, only process ten bits of information at a time. Is that coincidence, or is that a bridge between the intuition of numbers and the intuition of language: of the etymologic, the semiotic, the memetic?

Hypothesis on Psychedelic Fractals
I procure an intuition of fractals from my experience of fractals: during the psychedelic experience, a proper titration of dopamine and serotonin leads to intense joy, focus, and decoherence of sensation. The mind basically forgets language, and time, for a while; the intellectual hyperactivity both speeds up and slows down the perception of time; the outpouring of the unconscious feels slow, and the outpouring of he conscious feels quick, whereas normally it is vice versa.

In this intuition, the trajectory of the world may as well be the result of some cruel, secularist author, who is putting both good and shitty ideas to paper; and the product is entirely absurd. Is that not a metaphor for all creative pursuit?

I believe a bimonthly psychedelic experience would be a sufficient prescription of world peace, in an ideal notion of psychology and sociology. It wakes you up to the urgency of achieving love and creation, rather than fear and destruction. We 

Serotonin is complex-motivated; dopamine is simply motivated. Too much dopamine is constructive, or destructive; too much serotonin is constructive, or destructive, or both. That is why it is critical to absolve all stress and anxiety by fulfilling both of these dimensions. You yourself must actively contribute throughout the experience with meditation, reverence, and appreciation. That is the key to realizing the visions of fractals, which are the emotional sensation of the mind in the absence of conscious human desire, complemented by the totality of unconscious human pleasure.

The infinite cosmoses of color and shape, of love and elation, are fractals. Fractals are black holes, are zeroes, are imagination, are time and space, are evolution.

Artists are often many magnitudes more unhappy and anxious than their peers, because the pursuit of art is the pursuit of the other: the abstraction of the emotional and intellectual; the creation of beauty to subdue, or annihilate, mundanity and boredom.

Advocacy is the telos of consciousness. It is the recognition of the value and beauty of time and experience, and the instinct to share such beauty with others. Lack of philosophy, lack of humanist motivation, lack of internal identity, and hostility of intellectualism are the horsemen of genuine progress; they are the viruses of sociology, which exist as random destructive chaoses, who limit the potential of consciousness to competitive evolution, rather than relaxed imagination.

The structure of waiting until the collective is all together, sometimes long after the prescribed time,---but also demanding that the activity start at the prescribed time,---is... stupid. That model means that as a manager, you are expecting others to treat your activity exactly as you do, to possess the same perception of time as you do, rather than practicing empathy for the individuals of the room, who all desire to be there, but come from different worldviews and predispositions. The disrespect of other people's agency to time and space reflects only on your naïvety to see how vastly different and arbitrary such paths of respect are. It is better to consistently start the activity at the same time, never early or late, and set up after the prescribed time, so that individuals are allowed to be late, but disencouraged for being too late. This model helps shift the blame from the individual to the collective, of which is a fundamental component of the participation and enthusiasm of the individual. Hence, there is a lessening of offense, because you are freeing yourself of the stress of draconian expectation; preempting trust in the individual; and encouraging understanding when good people are unable, or hindered, cognitively or physically, from arriving consistently. The language of "starting to wait" is the function of prejudice, and often regress; "waiting to start" is the function of progress. We must as a collective believe that in all of us lies the heart of progress, which never deserves shame or guilt from unjust law and shackling order.

The valuation of emphasis on the beginning of events, rather than the transitioning of events, is a hallmark of unhealthy judgment. Appealing to a culture, or a law, that promotes this norm is fallacy; those concepts are more obvious and uncritical than the diverse possibility of moments, of histories, of time: the essence of empathy.

Reflection through time is empathetic; reflection in time is sympathetic. Immediate sympathy is much less critical than the historical mode.

Boredom to me is equivalently the domain of pure satisfaction.

Logical disorder, either contextual or contextualless, is the incongruence of language, for both humans and measurements.

The handheld coffee that somehow leaps itself out of the mug is an elegant representation of the behavior of chaotic numbers to harmonize and significantly develop into natural phenomena. The vibration of space causes the complex waving probability of more energized states to have a higher chance of synchronizing, occupying the same universal moment, creating order out of disorder. It feels right to assert that the passing moment is negated, created, and annihilated, in that order, such that the passage of time extends in one direction, but which we experience in modes. The measurement of things relates past phenomena to the instantaneous present moment; the object of measurement itself is always traveling into the future, from a point in the past. That ought to be the fundamental information of light, which really seems to be the temporal essence of experience, and which is an automatic expression of numbers in the form of electrons giving off luminous heat via rotational temperature spectra, and blackbody radiation, like from black holes. What we measure and think about is a highly stable, but technically imperfect, fading of light, which itself is always traveling opposite from the past, transforming in the present, and repeating through the future. The possible reason that we may never observe the constant of light fluctuate is because we are traveling with it; we are it. We are the result of a unique supercomplex of transcendental, computer-like algebraic geometry that powers creation and consciousness; we may be unable to generalize more than that.

f() = ∅
mod∅ := C(∅, i)
modi := C(i, e)
mode := C(e, f(0 + Z))

0 = 0^imod∅ ÷ ∅
f(0) = ∞ % ∅
f(0) × f(0) = (∞ - ∅)(∞ - ∅) =  ∅^emodi + ∞^emodi
f(0) ^ f(0) = ∫(0, fmode) = f(N)

Is unconscious probability and conscious projection the output of continuous convolution of spacetime?

To remember something I just forgot, I find it easiest to recount my history of events and thought processes up until then, in order to pull the same idea out of thin air: my conscious memory is far more limited in processing than the echoing bounds of my unconscious mind, whose time and space is rich and detailed, especially around the moment, rather than within it.
