OUTDATED WITH BAD NUMBERS. keeping for posterity :)

(ln(1) + ln(9) + ln(195) + ln(1791) + ln(61681) + ln(1015839)) * sqrt(5) = 89.044051

(ln(1) + ln(9) + ln(195) + ln(1791) + ln(61681) + ln(1015839)) * sqrt(5) + 1 = 90.044051

If ln(1) is changed to ~ ln(1.53343971), it equals 90 without + 1

1.618033988749

(ln(2)/ln(4) + ln(9) + ln(195) + ln(1791) + ln(61681) + ln(1015839)) * sqrt(5)
is approximately 90.162085

what if the ln series is extended to 12 terms?

90.162085         * 3.005698  = 269.99... deg
90.golden ratio * 3.0057074 = 271 deg

5.7074 × 10^−3 of error for ideal golden ratio

for actual, the error BETWEEN 90.162085 and 90.golden ratio is: 2.8155 × 10^−3

In nature, the golden ratio appears because it is an approximation of this error?

Mind that the decimal is not 100% precise; but if the integer representation of i is 90.044051, then it takes 3mod12 full turns (and a nudge!) before the log10 decimal becomes precise enough to use a ceiling function to achieve exactly 1 degree of error (natural degree + 1); otherwise, the floor function remains prevalent. In subtracting 1 to account for this degree of error, what if we are introducing the potential of another module of i?

for only 1 turns, such that f(90.162085) = 91, it takes a coefficient of 1.003747861

for only 2 turns, such that f(90.162085) = 181, it takes a coefficient of 2.002 to enable the action of the ceiling function

for 3 turns, such that f(90.162085) = 271, it takes a coefficient of 3.0002
